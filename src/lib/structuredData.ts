 * The name Google prints above the URL in a search result.

 * Google picks one site name per host and reads `WebSite.name` first, ahead of
 * `og:site_name`, `<title>` and headings. Without this node the site inherited
 * the name Google had already derived for the parent domain — `cloudkid.link`
 * publishes `"name": "Cloudkid Consulting"` — and church results appeared
 * branded as a consultancy.
 *
 * Google only reads this from a host's **home page**, so it has to be present
 * on `/`. It is emitted on every page anyway: the node describes the site, not
 * the page, so it is true everywhere and cannot go missing from the one page
 * that matters.
 *
 * Re-derived at the origin, so a domain change carries it automatically.
