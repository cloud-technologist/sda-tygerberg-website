 *
 * `search.list` costs 100 quota units against a 10,000/day default — about 100
 * calls a day. The client polls every 5 minutes and each viewer used to spend
 * separately, so a 30-person hour cost ~360 calls and blew the day's quota three
 * times over. Sharing the answer makes that ~60.
 *
 * **Only `ask` is cached, never the verdict.** The window and credential checks
 * run on every request, so the badge cannot outlive the window by up to the TTL
 * — which is what happened when this wrapped the whole verdict instead.
 *
 * A `null` answer is cached too, on purpose: when quota *is* exhausted, retrying
 * on every request is the worst available behaviour.
 *
 * The cache is per-colo, so the real figure is 60 × colos in play; for one
 * congregation in Cape Town that is usually one. Concurrent misses can still
 * stampede — arrivals spread across a 5-minute poll, so that is a few extra
 * calls at the start of a service, not a multiplier.
